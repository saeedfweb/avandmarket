//Many of them are directly in the plugin files - unfortunately. Some messages are tied to filter hooks that allow you to edit them without messing with plugin files but that's not always the case.
//The message you wanted to change was "Product Name was successfully added to your cart". This one is set in the function wc_add_to_cart_message in wc-cart-functions.php and this function allows you to change it using a filter:

wc_add_notice( apply_filters( 'wc_add_to_cart_message', $message, $product_id ) );
//So in your functions.php file you could add something like:

add_filter('wc_add_to_cart_message', 'handler_function_name', 10, 2);
function handler_function_name($message, $product_id) {
    return "Thank you for adding product" . $product_id;
}
